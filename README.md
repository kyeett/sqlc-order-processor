# State machines in Go 

Let's implement a simple state machine in Go that is easy:
1. to understand
2. to extend
3. to test

The full code is available in the [repo](https://github.com/kyeett/sqlc-order-processor).

#### Dependencies
* [kylenconroy/sqlc](https://github.com/kyleconroy/sqlc) - generate code from sql queries
* [matryer/moq](https://https://github.com/matryer/moq) - mock database layer for testing

## The State Machine 
We will implement a simple **order processor**. An order can be pretty much anything!
Our state machine will contain the following (main) states:

1. **created** - when order has been created, but not processed
2. **validated** - the order has been validated somehow
3. **broadcast_to_other_services** - some data about the order has been broadcasted to other services
4. **complete** - all steps have been completed. This is the end state of our state machine

Exactly what happens in each individual step is not important here, as we will focus on building our state machine.

### Code

#### Data layer
Our data model is very straightforward. Each order has an ID and a state. The state will be used for the state machine.
In this repo, it was generated by [sqlc](https://github.com/kyleconroy/sqlc), but could of course be written by manually.
```go
type Order struct {
	ID    int64
	State string
}
```
If we include configuration `emit_interface: true` into our sqlc.yaml we will get an interface that we can use for database mocking, which makes testing a lot easier.
It looks like this:
```go
type Querier interface {
	CreateOrder(ctx context.Context, state string) (Order, error)
	GetOrder(ctx context.Context, id int64) (Order, error)
	UpdateOrderState(ctx context.Context, arg UpdateOrderStateParams) error
}
```

### Application layer

```go
type orderProcessor struct {
	database data.Querier
}
```

Our `orderProcessor` struct contains the `Querier` generated by `sqlc`, based on the the data layer. The `orderProcessor` has the following main methods:

**CreateNewOrder** - creates a new order with the initial state "created".
```go
func (p *orderProcessor) CreateNewOrder(ctx context.Context) (*data.Order, error) {
	order, err := p.database.CreateOrder(ctx, stateCreated)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	return &order, nil
}
```

**StartProcessOrder** - takes an orderID, and iterates through each step of the state machine until the end state is reached, or an error has occurred.
```go
func (p *orderProcessor) StartProcessOrder(ctx context.Context, orderID int64) error {
	for {
		var isEndState bool
		isEndState, err := p.process(ctx, orderID)
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}

		if isEndState {
			return nil
		}
	}
}
```

**process** - performs an action based on the current state of the order and takes the order to the next step in the state machine.
```go
func (p *orderProcessor) process(ctx context.Context, orderID int64) (bool, error) {
	order, err := p.database.GetOrder(ctx, orderID)
	if err != nil {
		return false, err
	}
	
	switch order.State {
	case stateCreated:  
		return false, p.validateOrder(ctx, &order)
	case stateValidated:
		return false, p.updateOtherServices(ctx, &order)
	case stateBroadcastToOtherServices:
		return true, p.finalizeOrder(ctx, &order)
	default:
		return false, fmt.Errorf("unexpected state: %q", order.State)
	}
}
```
Example:
1. Get the order from the database
2. Based on the state, choose which
3. Perform action

Example, order `123` has state `created`, the next action is `validateOrder`. `validateOrder` will in turn do two things: 
1. Validate order 
2. If successful, move order to state `validated` (or maybe `failed`)

```go
func (p *orderProcessor) validateOrder(ctx context.Context, order *data.Order) error {
	
	// ... Code to validate order here 

	// Update state
	update := data.UpdateOrderStateParams{stateValidated, order.ID}
	if err := p.database.UpdateOrderState(ctx, update); err != nil {
		return err
	}
	return nil
}
```

That's it!

## Improvements

### Adding state to the state machine
To add an additional step after order validation, we just add it to our switch statement:
```diff
	...	
 	case stateCreated:
 		return false, p.validateOrder(ctx, &order)
 	case stateValidated:
+		return false, p.lookupAddress(ctx, &order)
+	case stateAddressFound:
 		return false, p.updateOtherServices(ctx, &order)
 	case stateBroadcastToOtherServices:
 		return true, p.finalizeOrder(ctx, &order)
	...	
```

### Extending the state machine

### Testing


## Conclusion
`sqlc` is a neat, easy to use tool, which makes working with Postgres in Go fun!

***Some things I liked***
1. Easy to set up and use. Very straight forward syntax
2. Changes to the database layer tracked easily by changes to `schema.sql` and `queries.sql`
3. It forces you to focus on the SQL queries; what do you need to insert and read from the database? When that is decided, the models in the code can be generated, not vice-versa.

A few other topics that would be worth covering in the future:
* Delete and get methods
* Returning a single inserted model using `:one` and `RETURNING *`
* Using transactions with `sqlc`
* Handling migrations
* Handling custom types, such as `github.com/google/uuid`
